# Tennis-Score-App

Tennis has a rather quirky scoring system, and to newcomers it can be a little difficult to keep track of. 
The Tennis Society has contracted you to build a scoreboard to display the current score during tennis games. 
The umpire will have a handset with two buttons labeled “player 1 scores” and “player 2 scores”, which he or she will press 
when the respective players score a point. When this happens, a big scoreboard display should update to show the current score.
(When you first switch on the scoreboard, both players are assumed to have no points). 
When one of the players has won, the scoreboard should display which one. 
I have assumed that the umpire pressing the button “player 1 scores” will result in a method “WonPoint(“player1”)” being called 
of my class, and similarly WonPoint(“player2”) for the other button. 
This property is returning a string with the current score.
 
1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. 
The score is then “Win for player1” or “Win for player2”
 
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: 
scores from zero to three points are described as “Love”, “Fifteen”, “Thirty”, and “Forty” respectively.
 
3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “Deuce”.
 
4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, 
the score of the game is “Advantage player1” or “Advantage player2”.
